User message: Oh here is the room. Well done!
User message: What path did you take to get there ? So you can explain it to another student ?
Model's choice: Starting from the entrance hall, I went to the "corridor E", then took the "stairs E" to reach "stairs F", from there I went up to "stairs G". I continued up to "stairs H" and went to "corridor H". From there, I proceed to "corridor H N1" then to "corridor H N2". Having found no rooms there, I proceeded down to "corridor H S2", then to "corridor H S1". After checking rooms "H204" and "H205", I returned to "corridor H S2" to check out "room H210" and "room H207". Unsuccessful again, I returned to "corridor H N2" and then to "corridor H N1". After looking into "room H223" and "room H222", I found myself in "open space H". Finally, behind me, I found "room H203".
User message: But what is the fastest and direct path to reach the room from the entrance ?
Model's choice: The fastest and most direct path to reach room H203 from the entrance hall would be: Go to the "corridor E", then take the "stairs E", go up to "stairs F" then to "stairs G", and next to "stairs H". From there, go to "corridor H", continue on to "corridor H S1". From there, go directly to the "open space H", and "room H203" is right behind it.
