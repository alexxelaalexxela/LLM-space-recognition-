Model's choice: Apologies for the confusion, but I can't execute that command. As a language AI, I don't have the ability to run scripts or programs on your computer. However, I can help guide you on running the command in Python if you need assistance. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Change to the directory of the script. You can do this with "cd". In your case the command would be `cd "c:/Users/Admin/Documents/ETHZ/Spring semester 1/Perception and learning 4 robots/Code/LLM-space-recognition-/"`.
3. Once you're in the directory with the Python script, use the following command to run the script: `python Test.py`.

I hope this helps. If you need more guidance, just let me know!

Model's choice: I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to run code or scripts on your computer. I can help you understand how to run Python scripts on your local environment, though.

To run a Python script on your computer, you would typically:

1. Ensure Python is installed properly by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in the terminal to check the installed version.
2. Navigate to the directory where your script is located using the `cd` command.
3. Run the program by typing `python` or `python3` followed by the script name like `python Test.py`.

For your specific code:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type `cd c:/Users/Admin/Documents/ETHZ/Spring semester 1/Perception and learning 4 robots/Code/LLM-space-recognition-/` to navigate to your script's location.
3. Type `python Test.py` to run your script.

Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

Model's choice: I'm sorry for any confusion, but as a text-based AI, I'm unable to run scripts or programs on a computer. However, I can guide you how to run your script in the console on Windows:

1. Open your command prompt (You can do this by searching 'cmd' in your search bar and hitting enter).
2. Navigate to your script's directory by using the `cd` command. For your case, you would use: `cd "c:/Users/Admin/Documents/ETHZ/Spring semester 1/Perception and learning 4 robots/Code/LLM-space-recognition-/"`.
3. Once you're in the correct directory, you can run your Python script by typing: `python Test.py`.

Please ensure Python is correctly installed and the environment variable path includes Python before attempting to run your script.
